Welcome To Vault 111!  As you can probably figure out (Or may you can't) I really like Fallout.  I have had blogs before but recently decided to move my blog from a hosted site to Github pages.  Since I did this during the Corona Virus Lock Down and I spend most of my time in my unfinished Basement office, I figured naming it after a Fallout Valult was appropriate.
